# Dotfiles
My configuration-files and an installation-script. The script replaces the dotfiles on the system with symlinks which refer to the dotfiles in the subfolder *dotfiles*. **WARNING:** The script removes old configuration-files without making any backup.

## Install
To install the dotfiles on your system run the foollowing command (no warranty and probably not a good idea):
> bash install.sh
