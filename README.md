# Dotfiles

My configuration-files and an installation-script. The script replaces the dotfiles on the system with symlinks which refer to the dotfiles in the sub-folder *dotfiles*. To install the dotfiles run:

```sh
sh install.sh
```

**WARNING:** The script removes old configuration-files without making any backup.
