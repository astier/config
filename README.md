My dotfiles and an installation-script.

**WARNING: The install-script doesn't make any backups! Do not run it without knowing EXACTLY what it does and which dotfiles are going to be affected. This script can lead to irreversable data-lose! The script replaces the dotfiles on the system with symlinks which refer to the dotfiles in the sub-folder *dotfiles*.**
